                   <div class="content-text">TSA, or Technology Student Association, is a club where students gather in teams based on their interests and work collectively to fulfill the final challenge of their events, fostering lasting bonds along the way. These events have challenges of many different themes - including engineering, computer science, arts, music, speaking/debate, and general science. Some of the events have members working together to create a final product for submission, while others are on-site and have students practicing throughout the year to demonstrate their skill and effort directly at the competition whether it be through debate, video producing, or a multitude of other events.
