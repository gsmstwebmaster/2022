                        Our organization was founded in 1987 by Bobby Sam and Gabriel Andrews, two well-known alumni from Stevenâ€™s Institute of Technology. Both were fascinated with coding and designing games from a young age and wanted to broadcast and share their experiences and insights with those who share similar passions. Currently, the pair run their organization from their local hometown of Boise, Idaho, and hope to foster game development in the youth generations of the United States.
